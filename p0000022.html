    <p><a href="http://www.signalpro.biz" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Signal Processing Group</a> is in the business of assisting its
    customers in
    developing and delivering custom analog microsystems and software. The following is a
    typical cycle of events through which SPG gets involved with a particular
    customer and their requirements.</p>
  </div>

<B>
1.0  Initial Contact:<BR><BR>
</B>

Initial contact between SPG and the customer may happen in many
different ways. Usually it is the result of personal referrals by
present SPG customers or a result of SPG's business promotion efforts
via the internet, mailers and advertising. Typically the very first contact is on
the telephone. This stage of the customer interaction tends to be one
of analyzing the gross fit between the requirements of the customer
and SPG capabilities. If there is a fit, then further discussion is
only a preliminary to the exchange of Non Disclosure Agreements before
any substantial technical exchange can begin. In the most usual case
this is done by <a href="new_contact_form.html" title="Contact" target="_blank">email with originals being sent by mail.</a><BR><BR>

<B>

2.0 Conceptual Deliberations:<BR><BR>
</B>

After the Non Disclosure documents have been signed and exchanged, a
more detailed technical conversation can take place. The customer may
at this stage, email SPG more information concerning the concept
he/she has in mind. This information can be in the form of:<BR>
<UL>
         <LI>  block diagrams, 
         <LI>  schematics,
         <LI>   written conceptual descriptions,
         <LI>   pictures/ photographs,
         <LI>   curve traces, measurement data,
         <LI>  functional specifications,
         <LI>   test specifications,
         <LI>   data sheets,
         <LI>  simulation results,
         <LI>  layouts, printed circuit boards,
         <LI>   promotional literature etc.

</UL>

Preliminary feasibility is established at this stage for the
realization of the custom microsystem via extended discussions with the
customer. After this SPG can respond with budgetary quotations,
preliminary project plans, recommendations, suggestions, development
strategies or any other material relevant to establishing a low risk
schedule of device development and manufacture as required by the
customer.<BR><BR>

<B>
3.0 Customer Review:</B><BR><BR>  

The customer reviews the proposal from SPG, and if it meets his/her
preliminary requirements from the standpoint of investment and time,
asks for a fixed quotation for the overall project.  This may consist
of quotations for Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) charges, device unit
pricing in various volumes, miscellaneous expenditures, schedules (
usually a best case and a worst case schedule) and a milestone
chart.<BR><BR>

<B>
4.0 Specification:</B><BR><BR>  

In order to provide a fixed quotation SPG requires the development of
a specification for the device. Specifications must be generated for
testing the device. The test specification defines a "good device". In
other words this is the acceptability criterion for both the customer
and SPG. The test specification is used to generate the functional
specification of the device which defines what the functionality will
be and how the device will be used. Both specifications must be
consistent with each other. The difference between the two
specifications is that a functional specification contains device
parameters which are internal to the device and not seen at the pins
of the device. The test specifications define what is seen at the
pins and what techniques will be required to test the device
efficiently. In some cases the customer may only generate the test
specification which is then used by SPG to generate the functional
specification. SPG can also work from conceptual descriptions and drawings.<BR><BR>

<B>
5.0 Firm quotation:</B><BR><BR>  

The specification forms the basis of the firm, fixed quotation from
SPG. If the specification is complete ( i.e. all parameters have been
defined and there are no TBD's on the specification) then the fixed
quotation from SPG contains all the required information for the
customer. If there are items not completely defined in the
specifications then those items will be not be considered in the firm,
fixed quotation. These items will be only budgetary and both the
customer and SPG will devote their best efforts to move those
specification items from the realm of the preliminary to the realm of
the firm specification. At this point all items will be deemed to have
been completely defined and the quotation will also be
complete.<BR><BR>

A firm quotation usually includes part or all of the following items:
<OL>
       <LI>      All Non Recurring Engineering Charges.
       <LI>      Prototype fabrication.
       <LI>      Silicon Breadboard(tm) fabrication ( if required).
       <LI>      Assembly. 
       <LI>      Evaluation ( 10 samples provided free of cost).
       <LI>      Test Program development for specified device.
       <LI>      Manufacturing Tooling for production quantities.
       <LI>      Required quantities of packaged and tested devices.
</OL>
</FONT>
<p><FONT SIZE=3>
  <B>
  6.0 Program Plan:</B><BR><BR>  
  
  A program plan is developed which includes review dates and times,
  reporting schedules, documentation types, milestones and billing
  schedules.  This plan is approved by the customer and the development
  proceeds according to SPG's standard development methodology
  which eliminates <i>unnecessary risk</i> to the program. This methodology is
  provided with the program plan at the start of an approved
  project.<BR><BR>
  
  <B>
  7.0 Device Design and Development: <BR><BR> 
  </B>
  
  For a detailed description of the development methodology of custom
  analog microsystems, consult the SPG development methodology
  documents available on request. <BR><BR>
  
  <B>     
  8.0 Confidentiality:<BR><BR>
  </B>
  
  All information provided to SPG by the customer is deemed confidential
  and should be marked "Confidential". We will always sign
  confidentiality agreements as and when required by the customer. The
  information transfer media may be documents, computer disks or any
  other tangible means of communication. Confidential information will
  not be shared with any third parties. If it is essential to release
  confidential information for reasons of supply or to obtain quotations
  on the customer's behalf we will seek written permission to do
  so.<BR><BR>
  
  <B>
  9.0 Ownership and patent issues:  <BR><BR>
  </B>
  
  If the customer pays for the complete development and manufacture of
  the custom device, the ownership is never in question. All materials
  generated during and after the development belong to the customer.
  However, in some cases there may be a <strong>shared fiscal responsibility</strong> between the customer and SPG. In this case the ownership is negotiated
  at the time the contracts are signed. SPG will always help the
  customer to obtain patent protection for a custom device if the
  customer requests it. However, the cost of such patents will have to
  be borne by the customer if the patent belongs solely to the customer. <BR><BR>
  
  <B>
  10.0 Orders:  <BR><BR>
  </B>
  
  SPG will not begin providing services under contract before the
  receipt of an approved purchase order, except for initial free
  consultations. <BR><BR>
  
  <B>
  11.0 Compensation for services: <BR><BR>
  </B>
  
  Compensation for SPG services can be by the project or by the hour
  depending on the type of project and the contract. We prefer
  compensation based on a complete project rather than hourly. In some
  cases, hourly payments may be appropriate, for example in projects
  which last for only a week or two. We have as yet not been involved in
  so short a project, but we are open to doing so.  Compensation may be
  negotiated as a mix of cash payments and royalties if business
  conditions warrant such a method of compensation. In general however,
  this will not be the case. <BR><BR>
  
  <B>
  12.0 Billing:  <BR><BR>
  </B>
  
  Billing by SPG is negotiated prior to initiating a major project.
  Invoicing is based on agreed upon milestones and clearly documented
  expectations and includes payment which initiates a program. </FONT></p>
<p><FONT SIZE=3><BR>
  
  Typical terms are net 15 to a maximum of net 30. Payment delays will
incur penalties negotiated at the time of the final contract. </FONT></p>
